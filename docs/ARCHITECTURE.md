# Marketplace Architecture

## Overview

This marketplace is designed to store, organize, and manage plugins in a structured, discoverable way. It follows best practices from the MCP Registry and modern plugin marketplace patterns.

## Directory Structure

### `/plugins`
Main storage for all plugins, organized by category:
- `mcp-servers/` - Model Context Protocol servers
- `utilities/` - General utility plugins
- `integrations/` - Third-party service integrations
- `custom/` - Custom or specialized plugins

Each plugin has its own directory with:
- `plugin.json` - Metadata manifest
- `README.md` - Documentation
- `src/` - Source code
- `tests/` - Test files

### `/docs`
Documentation for the marketplace itself:
- `CONTRIBUTING.md` - How to add plugins
- `ARCHITECTURE.md` - This file

### `/scripts`
Utility scripts for marketplace management:
- `add-plugin.sh` - Interactive plugin creation
- Future: validation, publishing, etc.

### `/config`
Configuration and schema files:
- `schema.json` - JSON schema for plugin manifests

### `/data`
Runtime data and catalogs:
- Generated indexes
- Cached metadata

### `/tests`
Marketplace-level tests:
- Schema validation
- Registry integrity checks

## Plugin Manifest

Each plugin must include a `plugin.json` file following the schema defined in `config/schema.json`.

### Required Fields
- `name` - Unique identifier (kebab-case)
- `version` - Semantic version
- `description` - Brief description
- `type` - Category/type

### Optional Fields
- `author` - Creator information
- `license` - License identifier
- `homepage` - Project website
- `repository` - Source code URL
- `tags` - Discovery keywords
- `runtime` - Execution environment
- `entrypoint` - Main file/command
- `dependencies` - Required packages
- `configuration` - Config schema

## Registry System

The `registry.json` file serves as the main catalog, listing all available plugins with their locations. This enables:
- Quick plugin discovery
- Version tracking
- Dependency resolution
- Automated tooling

## Design Principles

1. **Simplicity** - Easy to understand and navigate
2. **Discoverability** - Clear categorization and metadata
3. **Standards** - JSON Schema validation
4. **Extensibility** - Room to grow with additional features
5. **Documentation** - Every plugin is well-documented

## Future Enhancements

Potential additions:
- CLI tool for plugin management
- Automated validation and testing
- Version management system
- Dependency resolution
- Publishing workflow
- Web interface for browsing
- Integration with package managers
